# Project_Kojak
Final (5th) project in Metis Data Science Bootcamp

Aim is to use Deep Learning models eg. Keras and TensorFlow

Also to try out transfer learning, using a pre-trained model VGG16

Useful tool for SPCA to identify pet breeds, and NParks to identify bird species

Python notebooks (in presentation sequence):
1. simple_NN_model.ipynb
2. first_CNN_model.ipynb
3. CIFAR-10_Keras.ipynb
4. transfer_learning_VGG16.ipynb
